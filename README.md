 Practice data cleaning and initial analysis on a set of employee exit survey data.
 
## Analyzing Employee Exit

This project uses two employee exit survey data sets:
- [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey)
- [Technical and Further Education (TAFE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey)

I'd like to see if ther are any intresting observation between employee satisfication and total years they served in the institution.
